# React Hooks

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are basically functions that allow us to use React features without having to write a class. There are different types of hooks, but the most common ones are `useState` and `useEffect`. There are other very important hooks, such as `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, `useLayoutEffect`, and `useDebugValue`. In this project,
