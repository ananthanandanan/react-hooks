# React Hooks

## What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are basically functions that allow us to use React features without having to write a class. There are different types of hooks, but the most common ones are `useState` and `useEffect`. There are other very important hooks, such as `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, `useLayoutEffect`, and `useDebugValue`. In this project,
I am learning practical examples of the most common hooks. As in how to use them and when to use them.

## Hooks used

- [useCallback](./callback/)
- [useMemo](./memo/)
- [useRef](./ref/)
- [useReducer](./reducer/)
- [useDebounce](./debounce/)

## Why this project?

This is basically a project which I am using to learn React Hooks, how it works, and when to use them. This also works as a reference for me to look back at when I need to use a hook.

## Setting up the project

- Clone the project
- On separate hooks folder, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
